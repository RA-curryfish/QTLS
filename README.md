# Quantum Transport Layer Security
Simulating a secure packet transfer between hosts to ensure Confidentiality and Integrity. Uses Quantum Hashing for generating a Message Authentication Code. Also simulates a Man-in-the-Middle that can't figure out the secret to mess up the data in transit.

# TODO
- Implement quantum encryption
- Make a more robust quantum hashing that takes variable size input and gives a fixed output
